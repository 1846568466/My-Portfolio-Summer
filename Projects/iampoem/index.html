        <div>I like pineapples</div>
        <div>I wonder if there is a pineapple day</div>
        <div>I hear the sound of pineapples laughing</div>
        <div>I see a huge pineapple tree</div>
        <div>I want infinite pineapples</div>
        <div>I like pineapples</div>

        <div>I pretend to be a pineapple</div>
        <div>I feel the presence of pineapples around me</div>
        <div>I touch the pineapples</div>
        <div>I worry about the pineapples</div>
        <div>I cry when they get eaten</div>
        <div>I like pineapples</div>

        <div>I understand that they are supposed to be eaten</div>
        <div>I say that pineapples are the best</div>
        <div>I dream of a land where pineapples can live freely</div>
